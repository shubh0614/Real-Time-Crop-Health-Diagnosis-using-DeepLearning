# Real-Time-Crop-Health-Diagnosis-using-DeepLearning



Gather and preprocess data: Used a large dataset of images of crops with and without diseases. Used publicly available datasets. Then  preprocess the images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them to increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, the validation set will be used to monitor the model's performance during training, and the testing set will be used to evaluate the model's final performance.

Build the model: There are many different deep learning architectures that can be used for image classification, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We can start with a pre-trained model in this case EfficientNet and fine-tune it on your dataset or build a custom model from scratch. The model should take in an image as input and output a probability distribution over the different classes of diseases.

Train the model: Train the model using the training dataset and monitor its performance on the validation dataset. You may need to experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures to achieve the best performance.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset. You can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to measure the model's performance.
